# ZEGO Call

ZEGOCLOUD's Voice Call and Video Call let you build high-quality voice and video calls into apps that fit various needs of different scenarios, including social interactions, work collaboration, customer services, and more.

## Getting started

Before getting started with the ZEGOCLOUD Call application, **contact us to activate the Voice and Video Call (RTC + IM) service first**, and then do the following:

### Prerequisites

* [Xcode 12 or later](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download)
* [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation)
* An iOS device or Simulator that is running on iOS 13.0 or later and supports audio and video. We recommend you use a real device.
* Create a project in [ZEGOCLOUD Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/). For details, see [ZEGO Admin Console - Project management](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/1271).

###  Install Pods

1. Clone the Live Room Github repository. 
2. Open Terminal, navigate to the `ZEGOCallDemo` folder where the `Podfile` is located, and run the `pod repo update` command.
3. Run the `pod install` command to install all dependencies that are needed.

### Modify the project configurations

1. For macOs, open Terminal, navigate to the `call_ios` folder where the `configure.sh` is located. 

2. Run the configuration script with the `./configure.sh` command. And fill in the AppID, AppSign, and ServerSecret, which can be obtained in the [ZEGO Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/). 
**Note**: If you are using Windows system, double-click the `configure.bat` to run the configuration script.

3. Open the `ZEGOCallDemo.xcworkspace` in Xcode.

4. In the **General** tab of the `ZEGOCallDemo` project, change the `Bundle Identifier` configuration.

### Run the sample code

1. Connect the iOS device to your computer.

2. Open Xcode, click the **Any iOS Device** in the upper left corner, select the iOS device you are using.

3. Click the **Build** button in the upper left corner to run the sample code and experience the call service.

## Project structure

The project consists of two modules: **ZEGOCall** and **ZEGOCallDemo**.

### ZEGOCall

The ZEGOCall module improves reusability and further encapsulates the RTC and IM for you to integrate easier. The following shows the structure:

Directory path: 

```
{your_project_root_path}/call_ios/ZEGOCallDemo/ZEGOCall
```

```

### ZEGOCallUIKit

The ZEGOCallUIKit module is a layer of ZEGOCall packaging, simplified interactive video scene access, internal complete call logic and call UI.

Directory path: 

```
